Session with Ryan:
-----------------
Search of **sub-case** in the pipeline log:
indicator where it failed.
Multiple testcases might have failed, look for the first one

Take a note which sub-case failed.

TimeoutError -> indicates the device did not perform the warm-reboot


Next go to artifacts, it look for the logs with the sub-case.
before_reboot->syslog.99
    - search for "Rebooting with /sbin/kexec -e to SONIC-OS-..."
    check what this command was run
    - then in pipeline verify that the time is what we want

In the testcase log (syslog_routing_add_50) search for "VIEW"

Filter by error:
    "ERR, CRIT, synd, view, portsyncd, found key, PortChannel101"

For text power tools: "Filter lines including a string"

To look for src code:

github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage

search: org:sonic-net "error string"


Testcode: sonic-mgmt-int



# All the test code is in :
github.com/sonic-mgmt/
